Product Requirements Document (PRD) for AI-Powered Smart Contract Analyzer
Overview
The AI-Powered Smart Contract Analyzer is a decentralized MCP server with a ReactJS client-side UI, designed to empower Web3 developers by analyzing Solidity smart contracts for security vulnerabilities, gas inefficiencies, and logic flaws. It leverages external LLMs (OpenAI’s GPT-4 or Gemini AI) with specialized prompt templates to act as distinct agents for each analysis type, ensuring precise and actionable insights. The tool operates within the DeMCP ecosystem, adhering to its decentralized architecture, and prioritizes security, usability, and reliability.

Target Audience
Primary Users: Web3 developers building DeFi, NFT, DAO, or other smart contract-based applications.
Secondary Users: Security auditors, blockchain researchers, and educators reviewing or teaching contract development.
Goals
Innovation: Use specialized LLM agents to provide nuanced contract analysis, a novel approach in Web3 tooling.
Practicality: Deliver actionable insights that reduce vulnerabilities and costs in real-world contracts.
Security: Ensure no sensitive code is stored and provide transparency in data handling.
Usability: Offer an intuitive UI and clear, human-readable reports for developers of all skill levels.
Key Features
Contract Submission:
Upload Solidity files or paste code via a ReactJS UI.
Support for single contracts or multiple files (e.g., imports).
Specialized LLM Agents:
Security Agent: Detects vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, integer overflows, unchecked calls).
Gas Optimization Agent: Identifies inefficient code patterns (e.g., redundant storage, loops).
Logic Flaws Agent: Uncovers edge cases and logical errors (e.g., incorrect state transitions).
Customizable Analysis:
Users select analysis type (security, gas, logic, or all) and target blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon).
Option to prioritize specific functions or modules within a contract.
Human-Readable Reports:
LLM-generated explanations with issue descriptions, severity levels, and code-specific suggestions.
Visualizations (e.g., call graphs) for complex issues.
Fallback Rule-Based Checks:
Static analysis rules (e.g., based on Slither or Mythril patterns) to catch issues LLMs might miss.
Code Segmentation:
Handle large contracts by chunking code into functions or logical blocks for LLM processing.
Decentralized Backend:
MCP server runs on DeMCP’s infrastructure, exposing tools via the Model Context Protocol.
Security and Trust:
No persistent storage of contract code; temporary in-memory processing.
Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
Option for local execution (future enhancement).
Integration:
API for CI/CD pipelines or IDE plugins.
CLI for power users.
User Flow
User accesses the ReactJS UI.
User uploads a Solidity file or pastes code into a text area.
User selects analysis type(s) and blockchain via dropdowns.
UI sends the request to the MCP server.
MCP server segments the code (if large), applies rule-based checks, and routes to the appropriate LLM agent(s).
LLM agents analyze the code using specialized prompts and return insights.
Server combines results into a unified report.
UI displays the report with issues, suggestions, and visualizations.
Technical Requirements
Frontend:
ReactJS with Tailwind CSS for styling.
Libraries: Axios for API calls, Monaco Editor for code input.
Backend:
Node.js MCP server with DeMCP SDK.
OpenAI API (or Gemini AI) for LLM integration.
Solc or Slither for parsing Solidity into ASTs.
Temporary in-memory storage (no database).
Security:
HTTPS for all API communications.
Input validation to prevent malicious code execution.
Anonymized telemetry (optional, with user consent).
Performance:
Analysis completes in <1 minute for contracts up to 1,000 lines.
Handle contracts up to 10,000 lines via segmentation.
Dependencies:
Node.js, npm, DeMCP SDK, OpenAI SDK, Solc, Slither.
Development: ESLint, Prettier, Jest for testing.
Addressing Challenges
LLM Output Reliability:
Solution: Combine LLM insights with rule-based checks (e.g., regex for common vulnerabilities like call.value without nonReentrant).
Implementation: Use Slither’s static analysis to validate LLM findings.
Prompt Engineering: Design precise prompts with examples of correct/incorrect outputs to minimize hallucinations.
Handling Large Contracts:
Solution: Parse contracts into an AST and segment by functions or logical blocks (e.g., 500-line chunks).
Implementation: Use Solc to generate ASTs; process chunks sequentially and aggregate results.
Fallback: Warn users if contracts exceed 10,000 lines and suggest modular analysis.
Security and Trust:
Solution: Ensure no code is stored post-analysis; use in-memory processing.
Implementation: Encrypt data in transit (HTTPS); provide a transparency log of analysis requests (stored on IPFS).
Future: Offer a local Dockerized version for offline analysis.
Prompt Sensitivity:
Solution: Test prompts across diverse contracts (e.g., ERC-20, Uniswap, exotic DAOs).
Implementation: Maintain a test suite with 20+ contracts; iterate prompts based on accuracy.
Versioning: Store prompt templates in a config file for easy updates.
