I want you to build a frontend UI for the Solana NFT Marketplace Control Panel (MCP). The app is designed to let users connect their wallet, view their NFTs, see collection floor prices, access NFT metadata, and interact with an AI chatbot. I already did the design ( check the image attached), I want you to strictly follow the theme, color styling , then you can improvise the rest. So when we're done, we can connect it to our backend MCP server we built.

I’m still waiting for access to Magic Eden's list/delist API endpoints, so don’t implement actual listing/delisting logic yet — just show disabled buttons or messages for now.



The design should include:

Layout
A top navbar with app name, wallet connect button, and theme toggle

A sidebar with these items: Dashboard, My NFTs, Collections, Floor Prices, Listed Items, Activity Logs, AI Assistant

A main content area that changes based on selected sidebar option

"My NFTs" Page
Fetch NFTs from a connected wallet



Show them in a grid or table format with: image, name, mint address, listing status, and floor price

Buttons: View Metadata (opens a modal or slide panel), List (disabled or mocked), Delist (disabled or mocked)

"Collections" or "Floor Prices" Page
Allow users to input a collection symbol

Use /collections/{symbol}/floor-price to show current floor price

AI Assistant Panel
Floating chatbot icon in bottom-right

Clicking it opens a slide-out panel with a chat interface

Agent can help users with NFT questions, floor prices, metadata explanation, etc.

Technical Stack
Use React + Tailwind CSS or ShadCN components

Use @solana/wallet-adapter for wallet integration

Use Zustand or Redux for state management

Use the Helius RPC endpoints for NFT fetching and metadata

Don't implement list/delist logic yet — just show placeholder modals or logs.
Structure the project clearly and make sure it’s clean, modern, responsive, and easy to build upon.
